### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Ben, a Master's student at the University of Bonn. I am fortunate to be writing my Master's thesis under the guidance of [Goran RadanoviÄ‡](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gradanovic/) from the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on robust alignment of large language models
- ðŸŒ± Previously I worked on reinforcement learning theory and computer vision for plant inspection
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: `benrank (at) mpi-sws.org`

#### Publication
- [Performative Reinforcement Learning in Gradually Shifting Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09838), 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, 2024
